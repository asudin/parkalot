# Park-a-lot (3D)
 
> The **Park-a-lot** is a puzzle game where the player must solve each level by pushing the parked cars out of the parking lot. The game is a simple copy of the Parking Jam 3D game, made as a practice project in order to understand the mechanics and improve on features that I was frustrated with. Made as a project during internship in Agava on the Agava Unity Developer online course. 

## Features
- **Version**: Unity 2021.3 (LTS)
- **Tags**: Puzzle , 3D, Lowpoly
